+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when there is a push to the "master" branch.
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECR_REPOSITORY` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of the `AWS_REGION` environment variable in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_SERVICE` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the Amazon ECS service.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_CLUSTER` environment variable in the workflow below with the name you set for the cluster.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` environment variable in the workflow below with the path to the JSON file.
+#    Replace the value of the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable in the workflow below with the name of the container
+#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
+#
+# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
+#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
+#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

Organization owners can set team creation permissions.

If you do not set team creation permissions, all organization members will be able to create teams by default.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}

1. Under "Team creation rules", select or deselect **Allow members to create teams**.
